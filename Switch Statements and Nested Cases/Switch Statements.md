Switch Statements are like basically nested `if` / `else if` in one another.
Basically it is a simpler way to writing conditions.

```syntax
switch (variable) {
	case:
		// body
		break;
	case:
		// body
		break;
	case:
		// body
		break;
	default:
		// body
}
```
> [!NOTE] NOTE
> - Cases have to be the same type as expressions, must be a constant or literal.
> - Duplicate case values are not allowed.
