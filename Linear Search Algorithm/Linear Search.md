- So, basically it says that start searching frorm the first element till you reach the end.
- Each and every element in an array can be accessed using something we call an [[Index of an Array|index]]., and to iterate over an array we can use either a [[Loops#For Loop|for loop]] or [[for-each loop]].
- If the element is not found the method returns _-1_, else it returns the _nth_

#### Time Complexity
It is "the amount of time growing according to the input growth".

- The best case for a linear search is when the element is found in the first index. $O(1)$
- The worst case is when the element is not present in the array. $O(n)$
