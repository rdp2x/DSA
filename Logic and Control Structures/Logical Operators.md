There are three basic Logical Operators. All of them are used either with conditions or conditions.
The three operators are:

##### AND
- The AND operator uses the symbol `&&`.
- It is used when there are two or more conditions and we want to execute the code only if both or all of them are true.
```Example
a = 10;
b = 20;

if (a == 10 && b == 20)  {
	// body
}
```
##### OR
- The OR operator uses the symbol `||`
- It is used when there are two or more conditions and we want to execute the code even if either one of them is true.
```Example
a = 10;
b = 20;

if (a == 10 || b == 20)  {
	// body
}
```
