- A comparison sorting method. 
- In every step, adjacent elements are compared and sorted. 
- One whole traversal over the array (one pass), sends the largest element at the end. 
- Similarly, in the 2nd pass, the second largest element come to the second last index. 
- So basically for the $n^{th}$ pass, the $n^{th}$ largest number of element is at $n^{th}$ position before the largest element.
