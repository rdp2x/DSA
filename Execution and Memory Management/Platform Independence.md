Java is platform independent because java isn't directly compiled into machine code, rather first it get compiled into something called _byte code_ and that byte code then compiles into machine code.

What Platform Independence means is:
- It means that byte code can run on any OS.
- This executable code is a set of instruction s for the computer.
- After compiling C/C++ code we get.exe file which is platform dependent. In java we get byte code, that JVM converts to machine code.

We need to convert source code to machine code so computer can understand it. Compiler helps in doing this by turning it into executable code. Java is platform independent but JVM is platform dependent

The Basic Structure of how a Java code runs is [[Java Code Execution|here]]
